# Usage:
#   curl -k -sSL https://<server>/uninstall.sh | bash
#
# Wipes the agent end-to-end: systemd units (agent + bundled exporters),
# binary, env, logs, bundled plugin binaries, plugin work dir (rendered
# configs + subprocess logs + .upgrade stage dir), and the service user.
# Idempotent — safe to re-run.

# Stop + disable units unconditionally. The previous "list-unit-files

# hosts where the output formatting (leading whitespace, deprecated/
# masked decorations, paged output) confused the anchored grep. The
# uninstaller then went on to rm -f the binary while the supervisor
# was still running — agent + every subprocess survived, printed [OK].
# `systemctl stop` is safe to call on an unknown unit (logs to stderr,
# returns non-zero) so we just suppress + ignore failures.
