# build-edge-bundle.sh — rebuild the ADR-024 one-button upgrade bundle on the
# manager host from the loose per-arch edge binaries already staged under the
# install's edge/ dir.
#
# Why this exists: the release tarball used to carry a pre-built
# edge-bundle-<arch>-<version>.tar.gz *in addition to* the loose binaries it
# is a copy of (one for install-edge.sh, one for the upgrade path). That
# double-pack added ~120 MB of incompressible payload to every release. We now
# ship only the loose binaries and reassemble the bundle here at install /
# upgrade time. nginx serves the result statically from /edge/ exactly as
# before, so the edge-side upgrade flow is unchanged.
#
# The bundle layout + MANIFEST format MUST stay byte-compatible with what
# dist/build-edge-bundle.sh produces and what apply-pending-upgrade.sh
# consumes (fields: sha256  mode  src_in_bundle  dest_path).
#
# Usage: build-edge-bundle.sh <edge_dir> <version> [arch]
#   edge_dir   the installed edge dir holding the loose binaries
#              (e.g. /opt/ongrid/edge); also where the bundle is written.
#   version    e.g. v0.7.159
#   arch       bundle target arch; default linux-amd64 for legacy callers.
