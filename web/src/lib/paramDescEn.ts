// paramDescEn — English overrides for built-in tool parameter descriptions.

// The tool JSON Schemas are authored in Chinese (they feed the LLM + the
// zh UI). This map provides the English copy for the en-US drawer so EN users
// don't see Chinese. Keyed by wire tool name → param name. Missing entries
// fall back to the schema's own `description`. MCP / extension tools aren't
// here — those are translated at a different layer.
